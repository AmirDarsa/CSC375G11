			<h2>What we've done so far:</h2>
			<p  style = "line-height: 1.5;">
			Our project centers around advancing the UVic Res room booking system. We initiated this project by 
			crafting a project charter to outline our vision and approach in response to the RFP.
			Subsequently, we developed a business requirements file covering business rules, user specifications,
			and functional and non-functional requirements, along with a thorough exploration of defined use cases.
			This groundwork laid the foundation for a process modeling file, featuring detailed DFDs illustrating the system's functionalities.
			To enhance user comprehension, a UI prototype was created using Figma, providing a visual representation of the 
			system's overall user journey.
			For detailed insights, all project files including the project charter, business requirements, and modeling files,
			are accessible under the 'Project Files' menu. Simply press the 'Project Files' button at the top of the page to
			explore these documents.
