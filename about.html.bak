			<h2>What we've done so far:</h2>
			<p  style = "line-height: 1.5;">
			At the start of the semester, we brainstormed two project ideas.
			One was focused on improving the course registration system for the convenience of UVic students.
			The other, which we're currently working on,
			involves creating a new room availability and booking system for UVic Residence. 
			After presenting both concepts to our class, the idea for the new room availability system
			received more favorable feedback from both our peers and the professor.
